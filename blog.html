            <p>~3/6/2024~</p>
            <p>Sorry for no update yesterday...it's currently around 2am and I was at the movies with my partner and their father (he's visiting from the USA)...
            I made a github! Here's my 
            <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/luniazarova/luniazarova/blob/main/README.md">README.md</a></li> <p>:)</p>
            </ul><p>Honestly I've been so overwhelmed by x86-on-Asahi stuff...I feel like I have some sort of burnout. I need like a day or two of not using it so that I can provide higher quality testing materials. The biggest thing at the moment for my work on it is finding a way to have an FPS tracker/counter visable to an audience during the duration of a video featuring a test of Wine-on-Asahi performance. While the games are playable...a lot of people place value in specific numbers and I hope to start providing that data in a short period of time. I actually jot most of my findings in my notebook that I try to convert to electronic format every week or two. It's just a lot of pages so it's gonna take a morning at least.</p><br>
            <p>~1/6/2024~</p>
            <p>Happy Pride month! Last night and this morning has been such a mission. Had to buy a new domain because Namecheap decided to refund my order and someone else
            bought the domain :/ oh well. At least we're back. :) Today I'm not running any x86 software because I want to see how the battery does running only ARM applications.</p>

            <p>Great numbers lately for Civ5 Linux! This is with the feat/more-ram branch of `krun` from github (see: index)</p>

            <p>Finally! Doing another test of x86 strain on battery percentage! 80 percent at ~16:30 as a starting point. Running `krun FEXInterpreter /usr/bin/bottles` at the very least during the duration of the test. This time without Baloo...</p>

            <p>Update~ Civ 6 Gameplay on Asahi Linux!</p>

            <br> <p>Also, here's some energy information from running x86 software for ~2 hours without Baloo on...</p>
            <p>Civilization VI (Windows Version) is totally playable on Asahi Linux! How excellent. However, I've lost the ability to run GTA San Andreas and the Windows version of Civ 5...hopefully that'll be fixed soon!</p>

            <p>~31/5/2024~</p>
            <p>Update! ~ <br> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P77ngZUBtR8?si=k21-C9is9y1T4dMf" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><br>
            <p>Today may or may not be significant in terms of updates to asahi-krun. slp and teohhanhui are working on being able to provide more vcpus to `krun` as the current limit is 4. I'm not sure how much this will impact gaming but it may help in running other x86 programs...like Windows software!</p><br>
            <p>I'm measuring how long my M1 Max 16in MBP's battery will last while running x86 programs on Asahi Linux. I keep my max charge at 80%. Screen brightness 75% and Night Light at 4,500K.
            After 24 minutes the battery has dropped to ~71%. The past 24 minutes Bottles has also been installing Windows dependencies. I wonder if battery life will improve after Bottles finishes up. Maybe I can do some gaming.</p><br>
            <p>Down to ~61% after about 45 minutes...ouch. This might actually still be better efficiency than some x86 notebooks, though. At least after these install then I'll hopefully not have to install them again in the future. Here's an idea of how much energy this stuff takes: <blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/ok1Rhns" data-context="false" ><a href="//imgur.com/a/ok1Rhns"></a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><br>
          <p>I would like to have Mangohud display FPS data in Wine applications but so far I have been unsuccessful. I was hoping to try to do it today but 
          installing dependencies into windows has been eating up the past few hours and I have plans today :(</p><br>
          <p>Oh my gosh. I realized I had Baloo running in the background... I guess I didn't turn it off on this computer :/ welp I guess that means my battery data is complete garbage now.
          If you still care, it's ~47% after about an hour and ten minutes. I'll do another measurement tomorrow, I guess.</p><br><p>Here is some data after nearly two hours...

            <p>Well, I'm writing this after setting everything up here. This is an effort to distance our experimentation with unreleased packages from the main Asahi project.</p>
